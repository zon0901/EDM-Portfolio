# Final-Lab-Task-3.1
In this activity, we utilize the usage of MySQL clauses to interact with a database by retrieving, organizing, and analyzing data from a structured table. By following the guide below:

## Task 1: In this task, we are able to utilize the SELECT and WHERE clauses to retrieve all courses where the number of students_enrolled is less than the enrollment_limit.
