## Midterm Lab Task 1 
This portfolio demonstrates the process of data cleaning and preparation in Excel, focusing on transforming raw datasets into accurate, organized, and usable information. The goal is to eliminate errors, handle missing values, and ensure consistency across data for better analysis.

## 3-Step Process for Data Cleaning and Preparation:

1. **Identify and Remove Duplicates:**  
   Use Excel's built-in "Remove Duplicates" feature to identify and delete any repetitive entries, ensuring your dataset contains unique and accurate records.

2. **Handle Missing Data:**  
   Replace or fill in missing values using Excel functions like IFERROR, or apply data imputation techniques. This step ensures that all rows are complete for analysis.

3. **Standardize Data Formats:**  
   Use Excel's text and date functions to standardize inconsistent formats, such as converting all text to uppercase or ensuring uniform date formats across columns, making the data easy to work with for analysis.
